/// A boundary widget that enables hit testing for animating [AnimatedTo] descendants
/// and establishes a stable coordinate origin for position calculations.
///
/// ## Purpose 1: Hit Testing During Animation
///
/// When [AnimatedTo] widgets are animating, they visually move to new positions but
/// their hit test areas remain at their layout positions. [AnimatedToBoundary] solves
/// this by intercepting hit tests and checking animating descendants at their animated
/// positions first.
///
/// ## Purpose 2: Coordinate System Origin
///
/// [AnimatedToBoundary] establishes a boundary that serves as the origin for coordinate
/// calculations. This prevents [AnimatedTo] from being affected by ancestor animations
/// such as whole-screen transitions (e.g., Navigator.push/pop).
///
/// When you wrap a page widget (typically [Scaffold]) with [AnimatedToBoundary], the
/// coordinate system becomes isolated from navigation transitions. Without this isolation,
/// [AnimatedTo] would incorrectly interpret the page slide animation as a position change
/// and create unexpected animations.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// [AnimatedToBoundary] should typically be placed:
/// - Near the root of the widget tree for global hit testing coverage
/// - Around individual page widgets to isolate navigation transition effects
///
/// Example for global hit testing:
/// ```dart
/// AnimatedToBoundary(
///   child: MaterialApp(
///     home: Column(
///       children: [
///         AnimatedTo.spring(
///           globalKey: GlobalObjectKey(item1),
///           child: MyWidget(),
///         ),
///       ],
///     ),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// Example for isolating navigation transitions:
/// ```dart
/// @override
/// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///   return AnimatedToBoundary(
///     child: Scaffold(
///       body: AnimatedTo.spring(
///         globalKey: _key,
///         slidingFrom: Offset(100, 0),
///         child: YourWidget(),
///       ),
///     ),
///   );
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that [AnimatedToBoundary] can be nested, so you don't need to remove
/// other [AnimatedToBoundary] widgets when adding a new one.
